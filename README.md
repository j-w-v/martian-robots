# Martian Robots

## Initial thoughts

Use functions as objects as there is more than one robot / time limit

## Dealing with instructions

Start with loop over instructions

Extract grid size

Check if its a new robot “”, if so, create new robot and pass grid

Else check if its a start instruction “” -1, set position

Else add to output string

## Needed functions

Grid /
Position /
Robot /
Instruction Loop
